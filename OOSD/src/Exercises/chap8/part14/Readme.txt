Create UML and Java class of Stopwatch
Stopwatch contains:
-startTime and endTime (with get methods)

-no arg constructor that initialises the start time with the current time

-method start() that resets the startTime with the current time
-method stop() that sets the end time to the current time
-method getElapsedTime() that returns the elapsed time for the stopwatch in milliseconds

-test class
    write the test program that sorts 100000 numbers using selection sort
        swap the numbers
    start() to begin then stop() to end
