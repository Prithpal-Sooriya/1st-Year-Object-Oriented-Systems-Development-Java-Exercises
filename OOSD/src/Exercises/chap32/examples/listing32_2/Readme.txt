Create a J applet to show some text (called welcome)

Create a thread to implement a run method (you have defined)
    --> the run() method will show text and hide text
    --> make the thread sleep every 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds)
        --> need to catch InturruptedException if the run() method is being called when the thread is sleeping
