Server extends JFrame //so we can show a log of the communications
=====================
-ServerSocket serverSocket //used to create the server
-ArrayList<Socket> sockets //used to store all the sockets (and can use to count the number of users)
//DataOutputStream and DataInputStream can be used on the thread to handle each clients
-JTextArea //to hold the text when data is sent
============================
+Server() //constructor to create the server, will build GUI and network
+networking() //sort out the Serversocket, will call thread to handle each client

===========================================================

HandleAClient implements Runnable //inner class of Server, Runnable so we can use this for thread
=====================
Socket socket //the socket for the client
DataInputStream fromClient //data retrieved from client
DataOutputStream toClient //data sent to client
=====================
+HandleAClient(Socket socket) //constructor to initialise socket
//override method from Runnable, going to wait till a client sends info, then sends it to all sockets to display
//we will also send the number of clients connected to the server as well
+run() 
//once the client message is recieved, the message will be sent to all client
//may edit this to either send to all clients or all clients apart from the sender
+sendToAll(String clientMessage)
