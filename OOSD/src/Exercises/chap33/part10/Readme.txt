Multiple client chat

Create a server which will be used to relay messages across all the clients (users)
    --> the server will have an output log (JFrame) to show client-server communications

Create a client (JApplet) which will communicate to the server
    --> lets reject the input when there is no one on the server (and prompt the user that no one to chat to)
    --> later, lets add a counter of how many users are connected to the chat.
