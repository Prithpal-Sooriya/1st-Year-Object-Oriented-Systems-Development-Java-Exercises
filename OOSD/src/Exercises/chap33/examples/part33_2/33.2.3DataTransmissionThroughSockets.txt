Data transmission through sockets

After client socket makes a successful connection to server socket...
    -->...the communication is the same as I/O streams.

What streams to use
    --> the data sent through the Sockets can be any input/output stream
        --> if data sent is through a dataOutputStream, you must read data through dataInputStream
        --> if data sent is through a objectOutputStream, you must read data through ObjectInputStream
        --> if data sent is through a PrintWriter, you must read data through PrintReader
        --> ect.

How to get the streams:
    --> seperate the data from the socket, e.g.
        --> DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream);
        --> DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream);

    --> reading data (e.g. if this is from the server)
        in.readDouble(); //retrieve a double value from the client
        out.writeDouble(double d); //send a double value to the client
