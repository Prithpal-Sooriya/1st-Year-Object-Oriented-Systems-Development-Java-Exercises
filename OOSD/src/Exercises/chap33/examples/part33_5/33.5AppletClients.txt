Applet clients

The client can be an applet that connects to a server running on host which applet is loaded

    --> Applets can only connect to a host from which they were loaded
        --> thus HTML file must be located on the machine

    --> you can get the servers host name by: getCodeBase().getHostName() on an applet
        --> you can write a applet without the host name fixed
