Distributed Tic Tac Toe games

Create a server class that will create threads of server sockets so to have multiple games

    --> for each "game" there will 2 sockets waiting for 2 players to connect

    --> once a game is finished that server socket thread will terminate

Create a server class for which the players GUI will be displayed and player will make their moves
    --> the GUI will use a socket to connect to a server socket

Create an interface to hold some constants (this is what the listing shows)


More detail will be given in the form of UML (and I will describe what the code does)
