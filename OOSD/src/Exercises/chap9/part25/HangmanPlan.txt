Hangman Plan

randomly generate the word
    --> accessed from the array so just need to randomly pick index from array
        --> Random.randInt(min, max)? Math.Random
    --> word need to be ******
        --> find the length of the word and FOR loop to generate asterisks

user enters 1 letter at a time
    --> scanner
    --> while loop to repeat the board if they make a mistake/ continue with the game

user correct guess ****le
    -->store all of the users inputs into an array
        -->int userAlphabet[], all 0, until user says the letter, becomes 1
        -->use with the FOR loop when creating the asterisks

complete word, show how many misses
    --> store in "int misses" and increment when the player misses

complete word, ask to play again
    --> create the most outer WHILE loop with run command
        --> if the player says no, then game ends, if the player says yes the game continues
