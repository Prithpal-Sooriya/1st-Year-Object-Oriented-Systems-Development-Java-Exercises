The Triangle Class

Create a class called triangle which extends GeometricObject (a class in the book)

Triangle contains:
-->double side1, side2, side3 (default values = 1)

-->no arg constructor that creates a default triangle
-->constructor that creates triangle with specified sides (side1/2/3)

-->accessor methods for all of the sides

-->method getArea() gets the area
-->method getPerimeter() which gets the perimeter
-->method toString() that returns a string description for the triangle

draw UML and write code for Triangle

write a test program that prompts user to enter:
-3 sides of the triangle
-colour
-boolean filled or not

the program should display the area, perimeter, colour, true/false filled.
