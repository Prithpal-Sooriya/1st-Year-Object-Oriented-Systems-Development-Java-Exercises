Display Sorted Tuples
    --> use the ORDER BY keywords
        --> can order by ASC (ascending)
        --> can order by DESC (descending)
        --> default (if you don't choose) is ASC

    --> format
SELECT <list columns>
FROM <list tables>
WHERE <list conditions>
ORDER BY <columns to be sorted>

    --> if 2 orders are given, 1st order is primary, next order is secondary

    --> e.g.
SELECT
    lastName,
    FirstName,
    deptId
FROM
    Student
WHERE
    deptId = 'CS'
ORDER BY
    lastName DESC,
    firstName ASC;
