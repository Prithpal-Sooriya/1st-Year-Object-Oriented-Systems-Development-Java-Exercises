Creating a database

--> example of creating a database called "javabook" from the command line

    1) from command prompt type:
        mysql -uscott -ptiger //command line (this is to access the user we have just created)

    2) after the prompt (entered into user) type:
        create database javabook; //command line (this will create the database)

    3) to access the book, type:
        use javabook; //command line

    4) there are also a script (from Daniel Liang book, in supplement IV.A) which create and initialise tables
        --> done by using typing:
        source script.sql; //if the script is called script.sql, this line is implemented once inside a database (e.g: use javabook;)
