Developing Database Applications using JDBC

    -->4 key interfaces needed to develop any database application obtaining database metadata
        
        --> Driver = JDBC loads appropriate driver
        --> Connection = connects to the database
        --> Statement = creates and executes SQL statements
        --> ResultSet = process the result
            --> SQL data definition, SQL data modification, etc do not return results

    --> These define a framework for generic SQL database access

    --> these 4 interfaces make the building blocks for java database development
    --> here are what the code may look like:
    
    1) loading drivers
        --> appropriate driver must be loaded using the statement shown below before connecting to a database
            Class.forName("JDBCDriverClass"); //Class replaced by the class to access, driver class replaced with correct database driver class

        --> A driver is a concrete class that implements java.sql.Driver interface
        --> the drivers for the database access are different
            Driver class (what is filled in the "" above)
            --> Access = sun.jdbc.odbc.Jdbc0dbcDriver (already in the JDK)
            --> MySQL = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver (companion web site)
            --> Oracle = oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver (companion web site)
        --> you will have to add the mysqljdbc.jar and ojdbc6.jar in classpath using the Windows DOS command
            --> set classpath=%classpath%;c:\book\mysqljdbc.jar;c:\book\ojdbc6.jar
                --> replace c:\book\ with c:\"directory" or the directory of your code
        OR
        --> if using an IDE (e.g. Eclipse, Netbeans), need to add these jar files into the library of the IDE

    2) establishing connections
        --> connect to a database use the getConnection(databaseURL) in DriverManager class
            Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(databaseURL);

        --> DatabaseURL is a unique identifier of the database on the internet.
        --> URL patterns to expect for the unique identifier for the database
            --> Access = jdbc:odbc:dataSource
            --> MySQL = jdbc:mysql://hostname/dbname
            --> Oracle = jdbc:oracle:thin:@hostname:port#:oracleDBSID

        --> for ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) data source
            --> DatabaseURL = jdbc:odbc:dataSource
        --> an ODBC data source can be created using: ODBC Data Source Administrator on Windows

        --> connect to database using Access
            Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:odbc:ExampleMDBDataSource");

        --> connect to a database using MySQL
            Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/databasename", "username", "password");
        
        --> connect to a database using Oracle
            Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@liang.armstrong.edu:1521:orcl", "username", "password");

    3) Creating statements
        --> using the connection variable instantiated, create a statment
            Statement statement = connection.createStatment();

    4) Executing statements
        -->
