Save a query off to a file
    1) click the save icon (you know, the floppy disk)
    2) name the file, and store in a location
===========================
Troubleshooting problems
    --> if you make an error in the SQL script
        --> important to diagnose and fix the problems

    --> when there is a problem
        1) the spreadsheet/table will disappear
        2) output pane: shows red cross
            --> gives error code
            --> e.g. pric instead of price
                --> and indicates the name error in the field list
            --> e.g. "price," when there should not be a comma
                --> "error in SQL syntax..." not very helpfull
                --> however in the code pane, where the red cross is
                    --> indicates the error is there or above

    --> no problem/successful query = returns the number of rows returned
===========================
Create alias name for column
    --> the AS command
        --> <column> AS "desired name"
