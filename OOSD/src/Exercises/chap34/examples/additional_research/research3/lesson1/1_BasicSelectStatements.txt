lesson 1 part 1: how to write a basic SQL select statement

"-->" = indenting, information, and instructions
"*" = output

Schemas = databases
    --> will hold the tables, views, procedures and functions (routines)
=================
Information tab
    --> Clicking on a table will show all the columns (attributes) in the "information tab" 
        --> underlined attribute = primary key
=================
First Query
    --> query window should be open
        --> if not just click "file --> new query tab"
    --> right mouse click on a table
        --> click select rows - limit 1000 (limit useful if you have a stupidly large table
            --> this creates a very simple SELECT statement
                --> SELECT * FROM <table name> LIMIT 1000; //explicitly say to return max of 1000
            * This will create a table output to see the information from the query
            * output tab = action completed (green tick), and shows the number of rows returned
=================
Edit Query
    --> edit query "SELECT * FROM financial.security_transactions" to "SELECT * FROM financial.security_transactions LIMIT 10"

    --> THEN PRESS THE LIGHTNING SYMBOL (will rerun query)
        --> this will return 10 rows of data        
=================
Best way to format SQL code/queries
    --> 1 line of query is usually fine...
    --> ... but larger queries need to be formatted

    --> Formatting code is easily done by pressing the broom button (will beautify the code!)
    --> e.g. shown below. This can be changed if other sections need to be added

SELECT //first section of code for columns
    <column name 1>,
    <column name 2>,
    ...,
    <column name n> //no comma here
FROM //second section of code for tables
    <table name 1>,
    ...,
    <table name n>
LIMIT 50 //third section for commands
=================
Order a table
    --> of course you can call the ORDER BY method...
    --> ...but the table/spreadsheet created can be used to order data from specific column
        --> press one of the columns names above (not the data>
        * the table/spreadsheet is ordered by that column
=================
Query with specific columns
    --> just change SELECT * ..., to SELECT <column names>
    --> e.g.

SELECT 
    transdate,
    description,
    symbol,
    quantity
FROM
    financial.security_transactions
LIMIT 1000;

    *shows table with columns given (in the order they were written)
