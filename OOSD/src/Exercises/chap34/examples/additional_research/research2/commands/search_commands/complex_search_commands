Show records/rows once (so acts like a set/ no repeats)
    --> SELECT DISTINCT MONTH(birth_date) //DISTINCT means no repeats
        --> FROM students
        --> ORDER BY birth_date

Count the number/amount of something (returns an integer result)
    --> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sex)
        --> FROM students; //show 2 distinct genders (male and female)

    --> SELECT COUNT(*)
        --> FROM students; //shows total number of students: 11 students

    --> SELECT COUNT(*)
        --> FROM students
        --> WHERE sex = "M"; //counts number of males in the class

Grouping sets
    //IMPORTANT grouping will only store 1 value for each group
    --> SELECT sex, COUNT(*)
        //creates 2 columns, sex; and the number of individuals
        --> FROM students
        --> GROUP BY sex;
            //outputs M or F and shows the number of males and females in table
            //this is because sex is ENUM which has 2 options
                //so will group all 'M' and group all 'F'

Narrow query if after a query has been made
    --> Select city, COUNT(city) AS 'Amount'
        //columns: city; count number students in cities
        --> FROM students
        --> GROUP BY city //no where statement, so query has already been made
        --> HAVING Amount > 1;
            //HAVING command allows to test each row for amount, and check if they are > 1
            //IF > 1, then display
            //'Amount' is referenced by COUNT(city) via AS method

BETWEEN command
    //finds matches between the minimum and maximum
    --> SELECT first_name, last_name, birth_date
        --> FROM students
        --> WHERE birth_date
            --> BETWEEN '1960-1-1' AND '1970-1-1';
                //returns table of students with birth dates between 1960-1970

IN command
    //finds matches based off of a list
    --> SELECT first_name, last_name
        --> FROM students
        --> WHERE first_name IN ('Bobby', 'Lucy', 'Andy');
            //searches to see if first name is in the list
            //(bobby, lucy or andy)
            //if matches then outputs the name
