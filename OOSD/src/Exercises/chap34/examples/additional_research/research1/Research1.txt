Learn how to use MySQL WorkBench:

    --> create a new model
        --> a model of the database
        1) click on "file" on the top corner and select new model
            --> this will create a new model

    --> change database name
        1) right click and select "edit schema"
        2) type new name in the name window

    --> creating diagrams
        --> whatever diagrams created is a diagram for that particular database
        --> diagrams are not databases, but a way to implement a database
        1) Double click "Add Diagram" to create the diagram

    --> adding Tables, Views, Routines, Groups
        --> by adding one of these, this means they can be accessed from the
            other diagrams as well
        1) double click on "Add Table/View/Routine/Group" to add one of them
        2) of course, by highlighting the table you can change the name
           and other stuff

    1--> first thing you should do when creating a new model is change collation
        /character set that will be used
        --> this is located in the schema of the model
            (same procedure as changing name)
        --> default UTF-8 is fine
    
    2--> next create a new table
        --> so for example create a table called "users"
            --> create a new attribute "user_id"
            --> select datatype to INT
                --> BIG_INT if dealing with a stupidly large database
            --> select PK (Primary Key)
            --> select NN (Not Null, so data has to be give
            --> select UN (unsigned, so cannot be negative)
            --> select AI (auto incremental, so increments for each record)

        --> could also create a table called firstname
            --> datatype VARCHAR(45) for a String length of max 45
            --> select NN (so name has to be filled in)

        --> do the same last name

    3--> create a table for sales
        --> holds sale_id (primary key)
        --> holds user_id (foreign key)
            --> make sure to tick UN, as primary key is also UN (unsigned)
            --> to make sure this is a foreign key
                1) select "foreign keys" tab at the bottom of the table
                2) type in the foreign key name in the icon shown
                3) select the table that the foreign key references
                4) check/tick the box user_id in "Column"
            --> can also set up foreign key constraints
                --> such as what happens on update and on delete

    4--> create a diagram
        --> rename diagram
            --> right click and rename
        --> use catalogue tree to import the tables
            --> just drag and drop
        --> blue = parent (contains the primary key that is used)
        --> green = child (as foreign key points to parent)
        --> the arrow indicate the relationship
            -->many user_id's in sales to 1 user_id in Users
        --> can also create new tables inside the diagram
