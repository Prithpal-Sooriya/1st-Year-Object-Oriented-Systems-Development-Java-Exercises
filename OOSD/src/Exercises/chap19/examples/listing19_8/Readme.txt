Random Access File
    -->Data stored randomly on drive
why would you use it
    -->you can go to a specific location in the file (do not need to read sequentially like in normal files)
        -->done by using seek() operation
        --> great if you have a large file and want to skip some of the file to get to the item you are looking for
