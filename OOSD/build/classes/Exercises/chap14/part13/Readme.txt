Count characters in a text file

Write a program that  will count the number of characters, words and lines in a file.
--> words are separated by spaces (whitespace) on either side.

The file name should be passed through as an argument
    --> EDIT, lets use JFileChooser, as then we can test any file we wish
        --> will also remove chance of file not found or error when trying to find a file in a directory
