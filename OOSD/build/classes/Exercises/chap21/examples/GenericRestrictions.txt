Generic's have restrictions for use of the JVM

Why?
    --> the JVM converts generic code back into Objects to be backwards compatible to early generations of Java

restriction 1:
--> Cannot use "new E()"
    --> you cannot add a generic as a class to the heap

restriction 2:
--> cannot user "new E[]"
    --> you cannot add a generic as an array to the heap

restriction 3:
--> Generic type of a class cannot be static:
    -->class <E>{ }
        --> static void m(E e){} //illegal
        --> static E e //illegal
        --> static{E e} //illegal

restriction 4:
--> Exception classes cannot be generic
    --> myException<E> extends exception
    --> if you try to do a try and catch, the JVM cannot define the generic
