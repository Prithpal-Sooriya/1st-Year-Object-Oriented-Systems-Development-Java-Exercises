Displays a character on the JFrame

by pressing a character on the keyboard, the message will become that character
by pressing up, down, left, right, will move the character

TIP
y axis starts at top, so graph looks like thiS

0   1   2   3   4   5
1
2
3
4
5

So moving the char y axis is inverted (decrement to go up, and vice versa)
