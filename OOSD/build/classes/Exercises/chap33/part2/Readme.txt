Networking IO using Scanner and PrintWriter

Rewrite server and client programs for listing 33.1 (server) and 33.2 (client)
    --> Scanner for input
    --> PrintWriter for output


If I ever need to use Scanner and PrintWriter
    --> when sending data use these 2 lines
        --> printWriter.println(...);
        --> printWriter.flush();
