Sending and receiving objects:

As the input and output streams for Sockets can be anything
    --> we can use ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream to send and receive objects

To send objects, the objects must be Serializable
    --> implements the Serializable class
        --> static method are not read by Serializable
        --> if you do not want a datatype to be serializable, then use the key word transient
