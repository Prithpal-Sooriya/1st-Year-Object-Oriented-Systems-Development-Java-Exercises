Client/Server Computing

What does Java do to establish a connection:
    --> Java API utilises socket to allow communication


what are Sockets:
    --> Sockets are the endpoints of logical connections between to hosts
    --> can be used to send and receive data
    --> Java treats sockets as I/O operations (such as streams), thus sockets and be read from and written to

Network programming:
    --> 1 Server and multiple clients

    CLIENT
    --> clients first have to try to establish a connection to the server
        --> the server can accept or deny the connection to the client
    --> once connection is established, the client and server communicate using sockets
    --> clients sends data to a server, and the server responds

    SERVER
    --> the server must be running for the client to establish a connection
    --> the server waits for a connection request from a client.
