Server Sockets

Establishing a server
    --> create a server socket and attach it to a port
        --> the socket is where the server listens for connections
        --> the port identifies the TCP service on the socket

Port
    --> port numbers range: 0 - 65536
    --> however 0 - 1024 are reserved for privileged services
        --> email server runs on port 25
        --> web server runs on port 80
    --> you can choose any port number that is not used by other connections/sockets/programs

Java
    --> ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port)
