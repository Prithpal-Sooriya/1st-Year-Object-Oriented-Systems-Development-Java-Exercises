Client sockets

after a server socket is created, the server can use the following code to listen for connections:
    --> Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
        --> waits until a client connnects to the server socket

The client runs the following code to request a connection to a server:
    --> Socket socket = new Socket(serverName, port)
        --> opens a socket so that the client program can communicate with a server.
        --> "serverName" is the server's internet host name or IP address.

Examples for Client socket connecting to Server:
    --> Socket socket = new Socket("130.254.201.3", 8000); //param1 = IP address of server, param2 = port number
    --> Socket socket = new Socket("google.com", 8000); //param1 = domain name of server, param2 = port number
        --> The JVM asks the DNS to translate the host name into an IP address
