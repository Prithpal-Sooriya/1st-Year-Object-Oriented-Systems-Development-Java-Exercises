Case study: Distributed Tic-Tac-Toe game

This is going to be fun to make!!!

The Idea is to make a packman game with:
    --> 2 clients (the 2 players)
    --> and 1 server

However The idea of this is also to allow multiple servers to be created (through threads)
    --> so to have multiple games going on several virtual servers

More information will be given in the listing folder
