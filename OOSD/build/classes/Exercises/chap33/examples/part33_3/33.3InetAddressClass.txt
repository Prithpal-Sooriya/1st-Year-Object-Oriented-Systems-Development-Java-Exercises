The InetAddress Class

What if we want to know who is connecting to the server
    --> Use the InetAddress class to find the host name and IP address
        --> The InetAddress class models an IP address

============
Server:

Statement to use in a server program to get an instance of InetAddress
on a socket that connects to the client
    --> InetAddress inetAddress = socket.getInetAddress();

Next you can display the clients host name and IP address
System.out.println("Client HostName: " + inetAddress.getHostName());
System.out.println("Client IP Address: " + inetAddress.getHostAddress());

You can also create an instance of InetAddress from a hostname or IP address

InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName("www.google.com"); //static method to get address

*REMEMBER* InetAddress models IP address
    --> a good way to get the ip address from a domain name (www.google.com) and manipulate the IP address
