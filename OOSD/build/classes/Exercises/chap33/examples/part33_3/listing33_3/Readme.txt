Identify host name by IP

Using the InetAddress class create a program that gets the input's name OR IP address
    --> done by using static method InetAddress.getByName(DomainName/IP Address)

Then use the methods getHostName and getHostAddress to get the domain name and the address

*Reason Why this is important*
This is useful when you do not know the IP address by know the domain name, or visa versa
    --> this way you can get the host name and address easily
