TCP and UDP

TCP
--> larger overhead
--> enables 2 hosts to establish a connection and exchange data streams
--> guarantees that packet will be delivered in same order in which they were sent
--> lossless (can detect lost transmissions) and reliable

UDP
--> low overhead
--> connectionless
--> host to host protocol that is used over the IP
--> allows an application program on one computer to send a datagram to another computer
--> cannot guarantee lossless transmission
--------------------------------
Java allows both stream based (TCP) and packet based communication (UDP)
