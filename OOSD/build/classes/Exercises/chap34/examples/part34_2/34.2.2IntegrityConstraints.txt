Integrity Constraints:
    --> impose a condition/s that ALL legal values in a table must satisfy

3 types of constraints:
    --> domain constraints (intra-relational constraint)
    --> primary key constraints (intra-relational constraint)
    --> foreign key constraints (inter-relational constraint)

intra-relational constraint:
    --> constraint only involves 1 relation

inter-relational constraint:
    --> constraint involves >1 relation

Domain constraints:
    --> specify permissable values of the table
        --> can be specified by standard data-types: integer; boolean; ect
            --> standard datatype constraints can have BROAD range of values
            --> additional constraints set as well can NARROW range of values
                --> example: age range is INTEGER with RANGE 1-100
        --> can also specify whether an attribute is NULL
            -->null means no value has been filled/empty; DOES NOT MEAN 0
==============================================
Primary Key Constraints:
    --> To understand Primary keys, understand:
        --> Super keys
        --> Keys
        --> Candidate keys
    
    Super Keys:
        --> set or single attribute that UNIQUELY identifies relation
            --> no 2 tuples (rows) have the same values on a super key
                --> example would be ID (like student ID, or National Insurance Number)
        --> Definition:
            --> a relation consists of a set of distinct tuples.
            --> the set of all attributes in the relation forms a super key

    Keys:
        --> a Key (K) is a minimal super key
            --> meaning that any proper subset of the key (K) is NOT a super key

    Candidate Keys:
        --> from the point above (about what is a key):
            --> a relation can have several keys...
        --> in this case, each of the keys are called a candidate key

    --> What are primary keys?
        --> a primary key is one of the candidate keys designated by the database designer
    
    --> The primary keys are used to identify tuples in a relation
        --> StudentID is the primary key of table Student
        --> CourseID is the primary key of table Course
==============================================
Foreign Key Constraints:
    --> in a relational database, data is related
        --> Tuples in a relation are related
        --> Tuples in different relations are related through their common attributes
            --> these common attributes are Foreign Keys
    --> A foreign key constraints define the relationships among relations

    -->Definition:
        --> FK is a Foreign Key in Relation R, That references relation T if it satisfies 2 rules
            1) The attributes in FK have the SAME DOMAIN as the primary key in T
            2) A non-null value on FK in R must match a primary key value in T
            --> Example:
                --> CourseID is a Foreign Key in table Enrolment that references CourseID in table Course
                    --> every CourseID value must match CourseID value in table Course
==============================================
Enforcing Integrity Constraints
--> the Database Management System (DBMS) enforces interity constaints and reject operations that would violate them
    --> example: want to insert new record (1115, "CSCI", 2490, "C++ Programming", 0) onto Course table
        --> want to insert new record (1115, "CSCI", 2490, "C++ Programming", 0) onto Course table
        --> however say that there is no attribute (column) for 0, or 1115 doesnt exist in a foreign key
        --> DBMS will report an error and reject the operation

        --> if you were to delete a primary key being used
        --> DBMS will report an error and reject the operation
