Database system:
    --> consists of:
        --> database
        --> software that stores and manages data in the database
        --> application programs that enable the user to interact with the database system

Database: 
    --> just a repository of data that form information

Software (Database Management System/DMBS):
    --> what you purchase when you want to create a database
        --> MySQL; Oracle; Microsoft SQL server; Sybase; NoSQL

    --> DBMS designed for use by professional programmers (not for clients/users)

Application programs:
    --> can be viewed as interfaces (e.g. GUI's) between the database and the users
        --> application programs may be standalone GUI applications or Web applications
            --> application programs may access several different databases in the network

Rational Database Systems:
    --> based on the Relational Data Model
        --> 3 key components:
            --> structure = defines the representation of data
            --> integrity = impose constraints on data
            --> language = provides means for accessing and manipulating data
