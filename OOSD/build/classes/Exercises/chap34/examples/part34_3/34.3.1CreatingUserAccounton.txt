Creating a user account on MySQL

You can create a user account on the MySQL Workbench (GUI platform) or command line

Steps for creating a user from the command line

    1) mysql -uroot -p //command line
        --> will be prompted to enter the root password (that I you have set up when configuring MySQL)

    2) use  mysql; //command line

    3) create user 'scott'@'localhost' indentified by 'tiger'; //command line
        --> this will create a user 'scott' with ip address 'localhost' with password tiger

    4) grant select, insert, update, delete, create, create view, drop, execute, references on *.* to 'scott'@'localhost'; //command line
        --> grand privileges to user 'scott'
        --> enable remote access:
            --> grant all privileges on *.* to  'scott'@'%' identified by 'tiger'; //command line
        --> restrict the accounts remote access to just one particular IP Address:
            --> grant all privileges on *.* to 'scott'@'ipaddress' identified by 'tiger';

    5) exit; //command line
        --> exit the MySQL console
