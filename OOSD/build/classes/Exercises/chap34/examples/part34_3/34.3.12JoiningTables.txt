Joining Tables

    --> To join 2 tables, the tables must have EQUAL columns to be accessed
    --> EQUAL: no repeating data in column; unique in the table; data must match in both tables
    
    --> e.g.
SELECT DISTINCT
    lastName,
    firstName,
    courseID
FROM
    Student,
    Enrollment
WHERE
    Student.ssn = Enrollment.ssn
    AND
    lastName = 'Smith' AND firstName = 'Jacob';

    --> the join is done by using distinct data in the ssn column from both tables

    --> note: joins are like union/intersection/difference/etc from sets
