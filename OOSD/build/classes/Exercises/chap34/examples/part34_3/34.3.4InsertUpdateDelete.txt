Insert data into tables
    --> follows the code format:

INSERT INTO <table name> VALUES (
    <value 1> <insert in the way columns are set>,
    <value 2> <insert in the way columns are set>,
    <value 3> <insert in the way columns are set>,
    <value 4> <insert in the way columns are set>,
...
    <value 5> <insert in the way columns are set>
);

    --> you can also insert data into specific columns
INSERT INTO <table name> (<column name 1>, <column name 2>, ..., <column name n>)
VALUES (
    <value 1>,
    <value 2>,
    <value 3>,
    <value 4>,
..
    <value 5>
);
    
==========================
Update value in a table
    --> when updating a value, you need to be specific (so only change that one value)

UPDATE <table name>
    SET <column to change> = <new value that can be accepted into the column>
    WHERE <condition to make this update data unique>;

e.g.

UPDATE Course
    SET numOfCredits = 4
    WHERE title = 'Database Systems';

--this will change all users (or that single user) numOfCredits to 4, if the title is 'Database Systems'
===========================
Delete a record from the table
    --> to delete a record, have to be specific

DELETE <table name>
    WHERE <condition to make unique>;

e.g. 

DELETE Course
    WHERE title = 'Database Systems';

    --> to delete all records, just state:

DELETE <TABLE NAME>;

e.g.

DELETE Course;
