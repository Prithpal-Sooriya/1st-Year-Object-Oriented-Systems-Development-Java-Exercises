Displaying Distinct Tuples
    --> use the DISTINCT keyword
        --> will display the records/tuples which do not repeat from a specific column
        --> e.g. display all the different subjects by using subjectId
            --> note to self, you can use DISTINCT on a primary key to display all the values
                --> as each primary key is distinct
    
    --> e.g.
SELECT DISTINCT subjectId AS 'Subject ID'
FROM Course;


    --> basically DISTINCT removes duplicates of a column

    --> if DISTINCT is called on more than 1 column, then displays distinct tuples/rows
