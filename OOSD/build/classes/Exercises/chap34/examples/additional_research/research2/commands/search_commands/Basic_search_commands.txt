NOTE = when searching, it will also display resulting table to the screen

search through whole table (to display all contents)
    --> SELECT * FROM <table name>;

search specific columns (will show all records/results of the columns selected)
    --> SELECT <column name>, <other column names>
        --> FROM <table name>
    
search specific column with constraint
    --> SELECT <column name>, <other column names>
        --> FROM <table name>
        --> WHERE (conditions/constraints)
            --> can do all comparisons
                --> { <, >, =, <=, >=, != }
            --> can also use logical operators
                 --> OR, AND, NOT (can also use the Symbol version: ||, &&, !)

            --> e.g. WHERE sex='F';
            --> e.g. WHERE YEAR(birth_date) >= 1965;
            --> e.g. WHERE MONTH(birth_date) = 2 AND sex = "M";

search specific column is null (or not null)
        -->SELECT <column name (reference as x)>
            --> FROM <table name>
            --> WHERE <that column name x> IS NULL;
            OR
            --> WHERE <that column name x> IS NOT NULL;

order output (ascending or descending)
    -->SELECT x, y
        --> FROM <table name>
        --> ORDER BY x; //so display as ordered by last name, default (ASC)
        --> ORDER BY last_name DESC; //display in reverse alphabetical order

    //can combine the ascending and descending
    -->SELECT x, y, z
        --> FROM <table name>
        --> ORDER BY z DESC, y ASC; //first one gets precedence, so z descending comes first

limit output
    -->SELECT x, y
        --> FROM <table name>
        --> LIMIT 5; //so max 5 students
        OR
        --> LIMIT 5, 10; //starting index 5, ending index 10 (so next 5 items)
