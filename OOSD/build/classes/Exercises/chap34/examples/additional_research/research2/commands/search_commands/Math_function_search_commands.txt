Math functions

    --> SELECT
        --> test_id AS 'Test',
        --> MIN(score) AS min //min function, do not need ""||'' for name
        --> MAX(score) AS max
        --> MAX(score) - MIN(score) AS 'range'
        --> SUM(score) AS total
        --> AVG(score) AS average

        --> FROM scores
        --> GROUP BY test_id;
            //groups all the scores (from score column) of each test_id
            //then performs the math functions from the set given by group

    Other numeric functions
