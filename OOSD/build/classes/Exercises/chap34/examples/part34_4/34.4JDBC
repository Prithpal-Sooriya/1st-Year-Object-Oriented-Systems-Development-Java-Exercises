JDBC

    --> not an acronym, but can stand for Java Database Connectivity
    --> This is the java API for accessing relational databases (not noSQL)
    
    --> JDBC uses java to perform:
        --> execute SQL statements
        --> retrieve results
        --> present data in a user friendly interface
        --> propagate changes back to the database
        --> used to interact between multiple data sources in a distributed, heterogeneous environment
