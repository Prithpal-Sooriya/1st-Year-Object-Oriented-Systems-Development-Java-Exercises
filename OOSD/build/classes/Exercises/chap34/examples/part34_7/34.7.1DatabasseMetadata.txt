Database Metadata

    --> Connection interface creates a connection with the database
    --> within the connection SQL statements can be created and executed
        --> executions can return a ResultSet (from executeQuery(); method)

    --> Connection also provides metadata about the database (that it is connected to)
        --> describes:  capabilities of the database; supported SQL grammar; stored procedures; etc.

    --> to get the metadata use Connection's getMetaData();
    --> to store the metadata use DatabaseMetaData object to create an instance of it
    --> code:
//Connection object is already created
DatabaseMetaData dbMetaData = connection.getMetaData();
