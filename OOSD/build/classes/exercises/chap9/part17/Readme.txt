Guess the Capital

Write a program that repeatedly prompts the user to enter a capital for a state
Upon receiving a user input the program reports whether the answer is correct.
Assume that the 50 states and capital is stored in a 2D array.
The program prompts the user to enter all 50 states capitals and displays the total correct amount.
The users answer is not case sensitive.

-> instead of using a 2D array, try using an input file and getResource method.
